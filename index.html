                        Immersive technologies hold the key to transforming how we interact with the
                        digital world by creating more engaging, realistic, and interactive experiences.
                        Reimagining Rochester’s library collections, these technologies offer an opportunity
                        to transform teaching and learning. By integrating VR (virtual reality) into library
                        resources, we can invite users to not just passively consume information, but to
                        actively engage with it.

                        The vision at Studio X was a clear focus on presenting and celebrating the diverse and
                        global history of alchemical practices. From the outset, the team was committed to promoting a
                        more inclusive and expansive view of history, challenging the traditional Eurocentric narratives of
                        alchemy and highlighting its rich traditions across various cultures.

                        comfortable, and enriching for all participants. Features like force grab and teleportation movement were
                        employed to reduce motion sickness and conflicting sensory exposure.

                        ensure a system where players could pick up tools, mix ingredients, and observe the transformation of
                        materials—all while maintaining the sense of immersion crucial to the experience.

                        The concept of Study Spaces was born during the 10th anniversary of RIT’s premier hackathon,
                        BrickHack X, and was developed alongside an incredibly talented team, including Kayla Lin
                        (now of Ramp), Bon Anh Nguyen, and Jassem Toumi. We all shared a passion for using software to
                        empower users, driven by a common goal to create meaningful, impactful solutions that
                        address real-world challenges.

                      <p>
                        Our inspiration stemmed from popular educational platforms of our childhood,
                        like Kahoot and Quizizz, which brought a sense of fun and competition to learning.
                        And recognizing the huge wave of trendy products powered by AI, we collaborated to
                        build on that foundation by designing a platform to optimize the study environment for
                        students by streamlining that gamified experience that allows them to practice learning
                        materials and test their knowledge against peers in a friendly competitive setting using AI
                        to dynamically tailor quiz content to the user’s study materials.

                      <p>
                        After solidifying our concept, we turned our focus to selecting the right tech stack
                        for the project. Driven by a desire to push boundaries and explore new technologies,
                        we saw Cloudflare's challenge to leverage their new tool, Workers AI,
                        as an exciting opportunity to implement machine learning models on a global,
                        serverless GPU network, bringing our idea to life. Kayla, being our senior and
                        an absolute front-end wizard guru, brought extensive experience with building out
                        Express.js and Next.js apps, guiding us forward with her expertise. We moved to the next
                        steps of setting up the core infrastructure for multiplayer sessions, which involves
                        supporting real-time interaction to allow multiple users joining quizzes simultaneously.

                    <div data-type="text">
                      <p>
                        To enable this seamless experience where players could easily join and leave game rooms,
                        we chose Socket.IO for its reliable, real-time, two-way communication capabilities.
                        Its robust support for event-driven communication made it ideal for managing the dynamic
                        interactions essential to our multiplayer quiz environment. We were then able to maintain
                        persistent connections between the server and clients, ensuring that updates—such as new
                        questions, player responses, and scores—were instantly synchronized across all users in asession.

                    <div data-type="text">
                      <p>
                        With our connection in place, we turned to building out the backend to manage the core functionalities
                        and data flow of Study Spaces. Using Express.js as our basis, we set up routes for session management
                        and data handling, integrating MySQL as our database to store essential data—such as user profiles,
                        study materials, and session history—ensuring scalability as the platform grows. And with Workers AI
                        hooked up to process content and generate questions in real time, we could relay our dynamic quizzes to the
                        frontend through Socket.IO to display the game to the users synchronously. Additionally, we implemented game
                        logic to handle room creation, score updates, and player actions, enabling smooth, interactive sessions for all
                        participants.

                      <p>
                        Now all of this intricate backend would be for naught without a frontend capable of delivering an
                        intuitive and engaging experience for its users. Crafting the components for quiz interactions,
                        score displays, and score displays came easy with Kayla at the helm, and facilitating the gamified,
                        collaborative experience we envisioned for Study Spaces really came to life once we bridged our user
                        interface with processes behind the scene.

                        study tool committed to transforming how users view engaging with learning materials.
                        By focusing on how we can make learning platforms more interactive and accessible and blending them
                        with our current day cutting-edge technology, we reinforced our commitment to developing tools that use
                        technology to enhance educational experiences and build communities.

                        Our project’s impact was recognized at BrickHack X, where we were honored with the 'Best AI Hack' award
                        presented by Cloudflare. As judges, fellow hackers, and other users viewed and tested our product,
                        we received a wealth of new ideas and valuable perspectives. For instance, a professor suggested that
                        the platform could be especially beneficial for creating tests tailored to student learning needs.
                        This experience affirmed our excitement for how tech products can meet the diverse needs of different
                        clients, users, and communities, and we’re all eager to pursue the next horizon of learning and innovation.

                      Simple Email Beacon traces its origins from a summer brainstorming session with a friend,
                      where we saw an opportunity to develop a tracking tool that could capture key data points
                      (e.g., IP address, server location, time) and empower users to monitor access to data-sensitive
                      content. Recognizing that over 90% of cybercrimes are initiated through email, we saw the chance
                      to make a project that could serve as a public good that anyone could intuitively use and benefit from.
